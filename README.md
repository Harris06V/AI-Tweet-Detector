AI Tweet Detector

This browser extension scans tweets on Twitter/X and highlights ones that look like they were written by AI.

How it works:

The extension looks at each tweet and checks for common AI patterns like certain words (delve, tapestry, multifaceted), phrases (it's important to note that, let's unpack), and writing styles (overly formal, long sentences, lots of punctuation). It gives each tweet a confidence score and highlights the ones that seem AI-generated with a red border.

Installation:

Chrome/Edge:
1. Download this folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Turn on Developer mode (top right)
4. Click Load unpacked
5. Select this folder
6. Go to twitter.com or x.com

Firefox:
1. Download this folder
2. Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
3. Click Load Temporary Add-on
4. Pick the manifest.json file
5. Go to twitter.com or x.com

Using it:

Once installed it works automatically. AI tweets get a red border and a little badge showing the confidence score. Click the extension icon to see stats or change settings.

Settings you can change:
- Confidence threshold (how sure it needs to be before highlighting)
- Show/hide the percentage
- Change the highlight color
- Turn detection on/off

What it looks for:

AI words: delve, tapestry, intricate, nuanced, robust, paradigm, etc
AI phrases: as an AI, it's important to note, in today's landscape, let's dive deep
Weird punctuation: too many em-dashes, colons, semicolons
Structure: bullet points in tweets, super long sentences
Generic replies: great point, well said, this is so important
Account stuff: brand new accounts, usernames with random numbers

Privacy:

Everything runs in your browser. No data gets sent anywhere. Your settings are saved locally.

Notes:

It's not perfect. Sometimes it'll flag normal tweets or miss AI ones. Twitter changes their site a lot which can break things. Use it as a guide not as proof.
